Logical Functions:
=================
AND() ----> TRUE only when all the given conditions are true.
FALSE()
IF()
IFS()
IFERROR()
NOT()
OR ()
TRUE()

AND():
=====
•	If both conditions are true, it will return true 
•	If both conditions are false, it will return false 
•	One condition is false it will return false 
        = AND("TRUE","TRUE")  = TRUE
        = AND("TRUE","FALSE") = FALSE
        = AND("FALSE","FALSE") = FALSE
OR():
====
AND:
= AND (logical1, [logical2], …)
•	If both conditions are true, it will return true 
•	If both conditions are false, it will return false 
•	One condition is false it will return false 
Formula	Results
= AND("TRUE","TRUE")	TRUE
=AND("TRUE","FALSE")	FALSE
= AND("FALSE","FALSE")	FALSE
OR:
= OR (logical1, [logical2], …)
•	If both one conditions is true it will return true 
•	If both conditions are true, it will return true 
•	If both conditions are false, it will return false 
Formula	Results
= OR("TRUE","TRUE")	TRUE
=OR("TRUE","FALSE")	TRUE
= OR("FALSE","FALSE")	FALSE
NOTE:
•	In excel Zero (0) consider as False
•	And One (1) Consider as True 
Formula	Results
=TRUE+TRUE	2
=FALSE+FALSE	0
=TRUE+FALSE	1
IF
=IF (logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])
•	It returns whatever value you specify for the TRUE or FALSE condition.
•	If logical test is true, it will true statement 
•	If logical test is false, it will return false statement 
Formula	Results
=IF (1=1,” T”,” F ”)	T
=IF (1=2,” T”,” F”)	F
