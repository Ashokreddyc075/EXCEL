VLOOKUP:
=======
When you need to find information in a large spreadsheet, or you are always looking for the same kind of information, use the VLOOKUP function. 
VLOOKUP works a lot like a phone book, where you start with the piece of data you know, like someone's name, in order to find out what you don't know, 
like their phone number.

=VLOOKUP(What you want to look up, 
        where you want to look for it, 
        the column number in the range containing the value to return, 
        return an Approximate or Exact match â€“ indicated as 1/TRUE, or 0/FALSE).
Syntax:
======
=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

Limitations of VLOOKUP:
======================
==>  One major limitation of VLOOKUP is that it cannot look to the left. 
==>  The values to lookup must always be on the left-most column of the range and the values to return must be on the right hand side.
==>  You cannot use the standard VLOOKUP to look at the columns and the rows to find an exact match.
